# My-Projects-Portfolio

## Description

 My project is to showcase my work to future employers. The reasoning is I want to better myself in a new career path. Thus I feel this is the best way to perform that. The sudden motivation is my family and a baby on the way to providing for them and having stability with a home. When building this webpage I faced a lot of issues with the CSS work getting everything to align just right. Also to start off by building a cell phone platform then upscaling everything for pc.
